# net-idps
My network IDPS I did for my final project in "Magshimim", not perfect but gets the job done

This is my first readme so idk what to put in here, basically this is a project I did for my final year in magshimim,
I made it together with another pal but this repository is all of my solo work combined.

Disclaimer: This project is an IDPS that supposed to sit on every device (PC) on the network,
I didnt implement any dockers so its purely for kali linux/debian.
